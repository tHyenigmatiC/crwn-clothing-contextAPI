ContextAPI:
    - Way less verbose to write than Redux.
    - Lightweight solution for local storage management than Redux.

Redux:
    - Can utilize he flexibility of redux ecosystem like sagas, thunk, being able to 
        handle async actions inside of redux middleware
    - Maintains recomposibility of our component using HOC like connect. It increases the 
        reusability of component.  
    Where as we loose all this systems using ContextAPI


When to use ContextAPI?
    We can use context API for smaller to medium projects. In such projects its better if we can
    skip all those codes and files that need to be written for setting up redux store. Also we 
    don't need redux ecosystems such as sagas, thunks and async actions. Would be ideal for 
    projects such as portfolio project, personal portfolio project, landing pages and projects which
    doesn't have high complexity, high code reusability.

When to use redux?
    When using redux we have the flexibility to use the redux ecosystem that consists of sagas,
    thunks, handling and firing asycn actions inside redux middleware. Comparatively it is more
    verbose than using ContextAPI. But its good for large scale projects, projects where we are
    implemented code reusability, complex projects, e.t.c.
